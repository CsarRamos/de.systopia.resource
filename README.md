# CiviCRM Resource Management (de.systopia.resource)

This extension provides a framework to 
* define resources
* define resource availabilities
* define resource demands
* allocate resources to those demands
* optimise allocations (in the future)
* report and autocorrect bad or missing assignments

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

## TODOs

The following things still have to be implemented:
1. permissions - the system has no permission system yet
2. 

## Requirements

* PHP v7.2+
* CiviCRM 5.35+

## Getting Started

Most likely this extension does not make sense on its own, but rather 
in combination with one or more of the following extensions:

* [Entity Construction Kit](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.eck)
* more to come
